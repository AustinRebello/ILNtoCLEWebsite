# ILNtoCLEWebsite
Volunteer project for NWS CLE where I was tasked with altering existing scripts and generating new ones to allow NWS CLE to automate their Climatology pages

NWS CLE wished to automate climatology pages on their site and asked NWS ILN for their website scripts to assist with that.
As part of my desire to continue volunteering with NWS Cleveland, I was tasked with looking into how replicable these scripts were to NWS CLE.
Upon determining that most of the scripts were usable, I began to convert the code from the deprecated hard code tuned for NWS ILN to dynamic code that can be used for NWS CLE or any other NWS office as long as they change the sites list and edit the database table and column names.
I also wrote some of my own scripts to fill in the gaps from what NWS ILN did not exactly have but NWS CLE wanted.
